# single-molecule-data

## Intro
The goal of this repository is to share the all the code I developed during my PhD thesis. 

## What you can expect from this repository

Even thoug it is work in progress, in this repository you will find:
    - Code to analyze data from nonequilibrium pulling experiments in Optical and Magnetic Tweezers
    - Code to analyze equilibrium hopping experiments.
    - General thermodynamic computations.
    
The repository is intended to be used as a Python module.
